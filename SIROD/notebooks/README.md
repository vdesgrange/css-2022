# Notebooks with plots

This folder consists of 3 notebooks and data used to generate the graphs in this notebooks.

The `data` folder contains data from several simulations of Malware spread on the MESA model.

- the `antivirus.ipynb` notebook contains code to analyse and visualize the timesteps until an antivirus is found, under different circumstances
- The `infected_offline_death_plots.ipynb` notebook contains plots about the average fraction of nodes that are affectedfor every timestep calculated for 100 simulations.
- The `powerlaw.ipynb` shows powerlaw-like plots that show that the relative fraction of infected nodes after a specific amount of timestep follows a powerlaw distribution for different network sizes
